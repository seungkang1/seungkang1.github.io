    <h1>Enhancement 3: Databases</h1>
    <p>For my third enhancement, I integrated a SQLite database into the rescue animal system to persist and query animal records efficiently.</p>

    <h2>What Was Improved</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Added database schema and CRUD operations using SQLite.</li>
        <li>Replaced in-memory storage with persistent storage to retain data across sessions.</li>
        <li>Improved data management, validation, and modular separation of concerns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>This enhancement shows my ability to work with relational databases, design schema, perform SQL queries, and integrate database logic into an application.</p>

    <h1>Final Enhancement: Capstone Integration</h1>
    <p>For my final enhancement, I integrated all the skills and concepts learned throughout the Computer Science program into a comprehensive capstone project. This project focused on refactoring and enhancing a legacy Java application by applying software engineering principles, using appropriate data structures, and implementing persistent storage solutions.</p>

    <h2>What Was Improved</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Applied best practices in software design, modularization, and refactoring.</li>
        <li>Combined earlier enhancements (modular methods, HashMap data structure, and SQLite integration) into a single, cohesive system.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated the ability to integrate technical knowledge into a professional deliverable that solves a real-world problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>This enhancement showcases my ability to synthesize knowledge from multiple areas including software design, algorithms, and databases, and produce a fully functional and maintainable application for a professional setting.</p>

    <h1>Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h1>

    <p>For my first enhancement, I worked on the <strong>Rescue Animal Management System</strong> originally created in IT-145. This enhancement focused on improving the software design and structure of the main Java class, <code>Driver.java</code>.</p>

    <h2>What Was Improved</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Refactored the <code>main()</code> method into modular helper methods for better maintainability.</li>
        <li>Created input helper functions to reduce duplicate code.</li>
        <li>Implemented the <code>printAnimals</code> method to provide organized output of rescue animals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>This enhancement shows my ability to work with object-oriented design principles, break down complex logic into reusable parts, and write clean, maintainable code.</p>

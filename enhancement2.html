    <h1>Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>
    <p>For my second enhancement, I focused on improving the efficiency of data storage and retrieval by refactoring the program to use a <code>HashMap</code> instead of an <code>ArrayList</code> where appropriate.</p>

    <h2>What Was Improved</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Replaced linear search logic with constant-time key lookups using <code>HashMap</code>.</li>
        <li>Improved the performance and scalability of the rescue animal management system.</li>
        <li>Enhanced code readability and maintainability by reorganizing how data was stored and accessed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>This enhancement demonstrates my understanding of data structures, algorithmic efficiency, and the ability to refactor existing code for better performance.</p>
